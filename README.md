### Team Members: Pratyush Pande (19ME10091), Sohan Patnaik (19ME30051), Souvik Basak (19ME10095)

### Problem Statement
- Model and analyse a single cylinder IC engine considering practical values of mass of piston and links, cylinder pressure variation (to the extent possible) etc. 
- Check the ground shaking forces and performance without balancing, with balancing and flywheel. 
- Plot, compare and discuss all results.
